Recommend Sell Pressure:          ◦ Based on the analysis, recommend whether adding sell pressure to the market is advisable at the moment.          ◦ Provide a percentage of how much sell pressure can be applied based on the authentic appreciation determined.

Example Calculation:            For example: Token A appreciated by 100% in the last 24 hours.            Similar tokens with the same market cap appreciated by an average of 20%.          The overall market trend showed an average appreciation of 20%.          The Cap Rate and FDV indicate a reasonable rate of return and potential dilution impact.          Authenticity Percentage:          Authentic Appreciation = Average Similar Token Appreciation + Overall Market Appreciation            Authentic Appreciation = Average Similar Token Appreciation + Overall Market Appreciation            Authentic Appreciation = 20%+20%          Authentic Appreciation = 20%            Calculating the Percentage of Authentic Appreciation:          Percentage of Authentic Appreciation= (20% / 100%)*100            Percentage of Authentic Appreciation = 20%            Therefore, 20% of the 100% appreciation is considered authentic.    above is just the example of how to calculate the authentic appreciation for a token and similar tokens, derive the formulae Take price appriciation percentage of a perticular token from price Appriciation and calculate the. authentic appreciation for the token and similar tokens.  calculate the percentage of authentic appreciation also show calculation steps for all the tokens provided.
